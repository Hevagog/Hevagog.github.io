### [Kiedy_Laby:](https://github.com/AGH-Narzedzia-Informatyczne-2021-2022/kiedy-laby) 
Project that involves a handful of students who are dedicated to improve the readability of a student's schedule at AGH. It aims to create a mobile application (Android / iOS) that allows users to access the schedule of selected groups and courses. The advantage of this solution over the usual methods (the department’s website) is the efficient service for auditorium and laboratory groups, as well as the ability to compare activity plans between different fields of study.
